# Logging

**Why logging?**  
Logging is useful when you don't want to check the cluttered audit logs everytime. We have all the important features covered in our logging module. 

> It only logs the actions of non whitelisted users. Hence, Anti-Nuke must be enabled for logging to work.

## Basic
If you've already used the command `/setup` then logging is probably already enabled. 

## Logged Events
  
 * Ban
 * Kick
